Thank you for booking with us. <strong>For your <u>enjoyable</u> stay</strong>, we have summarized some information. 
<p><a href="https://aibiya.jp/en/"
    target="_blank" title="AIBIYA" >AIBIYA is family-run guesthouse</a>situated in the heart of Yamanouchi town and 
    easy accessible to Yudanaka station(6minutes walk) as well as the restaurant and cafe.</p><p style="margin-top:40px;">
The easiest way to reach us from Nagano is taking the train called Nagano dentetsu”. It's approximately 60minutes journey 
from Nagano station to Yudanaka station. Though, you have a JR PASS, still you will be required to buy the new ticket as Jr pass 
is not applicable to the use of Nagano dentetsu line. The ticket will cost you around 1000yen one way.</p><img src="coding.jpg" width="100%">
Unfortunately, we don’t  provide pick up service from Yudanaka station to our accommodation nor the shuttle service for Jigokutani snow monkey park.  
There is a bus running to the monkey park from Yudanaka station which is 10minutes ride and the bus fare  is around 400yen one way. 
From the entrance of the snow monkey park, you need to walk the trail for 30minutes.

 In rainy season, we highly recommend you to bring your own hiking shoes(water proofed) or rain boots since the trail can be very muddy and slippery. 

As you will be in the famous onsen town "Yudanaka onsen village", don't miss the chance to experience exquisite onsens near by.
 Our guest can access 4 different types of hot spring bath near our guesthouse at a special price.</body></html>
